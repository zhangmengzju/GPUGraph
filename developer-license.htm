Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, SYSTAP hereby grants to
Customer a nonexclusive, nontransferable, nonsublicensable right and license to
(i) install and use internally the Licensed Software, solely for evaluation,
testing, research and development purposes, and (ii) demonstrate the
functionality of the Licensed Software to third parties solely as part of and
in conjunction with the beta release of Customer’s own system and technology
into which the Software has been integrated. Customer is expressly prohibited
from distributing the Licensed Software to any third party and from making
derivative works of, improvements to or otherwise modifying the Licensed
Software. These Terms and Conditions will apply to any updates, versions or
modifications provided to Customer, at SYSTAP’s discretion, that replace,
modify and/or supplement the original Licensed Software unless such update
contains a separate license. The Licensed Software may include individual open
source software components, each of which is subject to its own license
agreement and associated terms and conditions. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, each such component is licensed to Customer under
the terms of the open source license agreement applicable thereto, which will
be included or referenced in the license files, documentation or other
materials provided to you with or made available with respect to the Licensed
Software.</span></p>

This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws
of the State of New York, without regard to any principles of conflict of laws.
All disputes arising under this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in a
federal or state court located in New York, NY. Each Party consents to the
personal jurisdiction of such courts and hereby waives any objection to venue
of such courts. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable for any reason, the remaining
provisions hereof shall be unaffected and remain in full force and effect.
Failure or delay in enforcing any right or provision of this Agreement shall
not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision with respect to any
subsequent breach. No terms, provisions, or conditions of any purchase order,
acknowledgement, check, or other business form that Customer may use in
connection with the acquisition or licensing of the Licensed Software will have
any effect on the rights, duties, or obligations of the parties under this
Agreement, regardless of any failure of SYSTAP to object to such terms,
provisions, or conditions. Neither Party will be responsible for any failure to
perform caused by an Act of God or any other fact or circumstance beyond such
Party’s reasonable control. This Agreement constitutes the complete agreement
between the Parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous discussions,
representations, and proposals, whether in writing or oral, with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended or modified
in any respect unless approved in writing and signed by a duly authorized
representative of the respective parties. Customer’s rights under this
Agreement may not be transferred or assigned without the prior express written
consent of SYSTAP, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
and any such attempted assignment shall be void. SYSTAP may assign this
Agreement in its sole discretion. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.</span></p>
